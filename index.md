# How good is your map?
## About
{: .text-justify}
Compared to other branches of science and technology, robotics is relatively young. The field as we know it emerged somewhere around the early 1950s. Robotic mapping is even younger, and its history starts around the early 1980s. Despite its short history, robotic mapping has undergone great developments. Nowadays, robotic maps are fundamental for the operation of the majority, if not all, mobile robotic systems. However, despite the importance of the robotic maps, there is no common way to exchange the maps between different manufacturers' robotic platforms, neither there is a consensus regarding what defines a good map. Such a state of the field hampers the development of the field itself and fields depending on it. Developments in engineering usually come when common ways are established to define concepts and components and to measure the performance of such systems and components. Robotics makes no exception. Thus standardisation and assessment (qualitative and, especially, quantitative) of maps are of paramount importance.

## Objectives

Recently a few initiatives have emerged to systematically address these issues and a number of researchers have expressed interest in the problems related to map standardisation and map assessment. We believe this workshop will pave the way towards a more solid and consistent development of standards and quality assessment methods for maps.

The workshop is aimed at a broad audience from academia and industry. The goal is to attract not only researchers and practitioners actively working on the problem of robotic map standardisation and map quality assessment but also representatives of fields depending on high-quality maps. The aim of the
workshop is to spark discussion among the participants to define the objectives for further development of map standardisation and map quality assessment as well as enable broader adoption of already existing solutions.

Considering the importance of the topic as well as its relative obscurity, we aim to use the workshop as a way to advertise it to the broader community. To further facilitate this goal, the summary of the presentations and discussions during the workshop will be used as a foundation of a position paper on the problem. The workshop participants and the broader community will be invited to participate in the process of writing the paper.

**Title** Detection of Localization Failures with Probabilistic Modeling

**Abstract** Almost all modules used for autonomous navigation rely on localization results. Hence, localization failures might result in autonomous navigation failures as well. To guarantee safety of the autonomous navigation, we are focusing on how to detect the localization failures automatically. In this talk, I present probabilistic modeling methods to estimate reliability of the localization result and to recognize misalignment between sensor measurements and map. These methods enable a robot to know whether localization has failed or not itself.
