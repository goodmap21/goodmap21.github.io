# How good is your map?

## Welcome

Welcome to ECMR 2021 workshop on map quality assessment and standardization.
Below you can find all key informations of the today's event.

## Gather Town space

The workshop is taking place in a space created in Gather Town.
This tool works similarly to a simple RPG.
You can interact with other participants and some objects in the environment.
